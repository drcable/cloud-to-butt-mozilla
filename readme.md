# B.manning mozzilla

B.manning is widley thought to be a trasn* woman, or at least genderQueer. However they are constantly treated by them media as a man, in contradiction of journalistic standards. This extention swaps "Bradley manning" with "B.manning" and "he" with "they" on all pages you view. Hopefully it shouldn't cause too much confusion. It's forked from daveRandoms "cloud to but".
